Borderlands 2 Texture Mod Repository
==============================

This is my repository for all the individual skins and texture packs that I make for Borderlands 2.
These skins are meant to be used with the Borderlands Community Patch so if you don't have that
then [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e68MFnAuIPQ).

Current Weapon Skins
==================

## Hyperion Obsidian
The obsidian weapon skin is currently available on the Hyperion 1340 unique shotgun but will be available
on the other unique Hyperion weapons soon.

Notes
=====
The Hyperion Obsidian skin was made by using Aaron0000's 1340 community patch skin as a reference. I used his file as a reference to learn how to create custom skins in Borderlands 2 and this skin is still subject to change.
