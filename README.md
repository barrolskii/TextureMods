Borderlands 2 Texture Mod Repository
==============================

This is my repository for all the individual skins and texture packs that I make for Borderlands 2.
These skins are meant to be used with the Borderlands Community Patch so if you don't have that
then [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e68MFnAuIPQ).

Current Weapon Skins
==================

## Hyperion Obsidian
The obsidian weapon skin changes all of the Hyperion unique weapon skins in Borderlands 2. This pack contains two versions of the skin for
each gun. The full color skin is named "Factory default" and the mixed color/damaged looking skin is called "Battle worn".
Each of these skins can be changed in the BLCMM so you can pick and choose which skins you would like to have applied.

## Hyperion Asiimov
This is a recreation of the Asiimov weapon skin in CS:GO. This skin pack currently changes all of the Hyperion legendary weapons. At the moment this does not include the legendary grenades at this moment but this is subject to change in the future.

Notes
=====
The Hyperion Obsidian skin was made by using [Aaron0000's](https://github.com/Aaron00000) 1340 community patch skin as a reference. 
I used his file to learn how to make skins for Borderlands weapons.
These skins are available for anyone to use in there game. I would recommend checking the Todo.txt file if the pack you want to use
has a disclaimer that it is not finished yet to see if the changes that need to be done will change the pack drastically or not.
